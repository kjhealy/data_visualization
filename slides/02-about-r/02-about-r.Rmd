# The right frame of mind

- This is like learning how to drive a car, or how to cook in a kitchen ... or learning to speak a language.

--

- After some orientation to what's where, you will learn best by _doing_.

--

- Software is a pain, but you won't crash the car or burn your house down. 

???

- Don't be afraid of the IDE or code. Expect to be frustrated, and don't be surprised when things go wrong. Things will go wrong _constantly_. The software is a very powerful, very obedient, and _very_ dumb robot.

- But every time things "don't work", and every time you diagnose and fix them, you will become a little more adept at noticing and fixing these errors. And you will start to accumulate practical knowledge of common failures.

- So be like Jacques and keep at it.

# What R looks like


Code you can type and run:

## Inside code chunks, lines beginning with a # character are comments
## Comments are ignored by R

my_numbers <- c(1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 5) # Anything after a # character is ignored as well

```

---

# What R looks like

By convention, code output in documents is prefixed by `##`

```{r 02-about-r-4 }
my_numbers

--

Also by convention, outputting vectors, etc, gets a counter keeping track of the number of elements. For example,

```{r 02-about-r-5 }
letters

# 0. .kjh-yellow[It's a calculator]

Logical equality and inequality (yielding a .kjh-green[`TRUE`] or .kjh-red[`FALSE`] result) is done with `==` and `!=`. Other logical operators include `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, and `!` for negation. We'll use these in plots to filter data, test conditions, and so on.

```{r 02-about-r-14, eval = FALSE}

## Don't name objects with terms fo logical values,

---

# 2. .kjh-yellow[Everything is an object]

There are a few built-in objects:


```{r 02-about-r-15 }
letters

--

```{r 02-about-r-16 }
pi
```

--

```{r 02-about-r-17 }

LETTERS
```

---

# 3. .kjh-yellow[You can create objects] 

--

In fact, this is mostly what we will be doing.

--

Objects are created by .kjh-pink[_assigning_] a thing to a name:

```{r 02-about-r-18 }
## name... gets ... this stuff
my_numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 5, 25, 10)

## name ... gets ... the output of the function `c()`
your_numbers <- c(5, 31, 71, 1, 3, 21, 6, 52)
```

--

The .kjh-green[**`c()`**] function _combines_ or _concatenates_ things


The **assignment operator**, .kjh-pink[**`<-`**], performs the action of creating objects.

???

The core thing we do in R is _create objects_ by _assigning a thing to a name_. That thing is usually the output of some _function_. There are a lot of built-in functions.

We can create an object with the .kjh-green[**`c()`**] function and the *assignment operator*, `<-`. 


---

# The assignment operator

- The .kjh-pink[assignment operator] performs the action of creating objects:

--

- Use a keyboard shortcut to write it:

- Press .kjh-green[**`option`**] _and_ .kjh-green[**`-`**] on a Mac

- Press .kjh-green[**`alt`**] _and_ .kjh-green[**`-`**] on Windows


---

# Assignment with .kjh-green[**`=`**]

- You can use ".kjh-green[**`=`**]" as well as ".kjh-green[**`<-`**]" for assignment

```{r 02-about-r-19 }
my_numbers = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 5, 25)

my_numbers
```


--

On the other hand, ".kjh-green[**`=`**]" has a different meaning when used in functions.

--

I'm going to use ".kjh-green[**`<-`**]" for assigment throughout. Just be consistent either way.

If you don't _name_ the arguments, R assumes you are providing them in the order the function expects.

# Use the pipe operator: .kjh-pink[**`|>`**]

Instead of nesting functions in parentheses, we can use the .kjh-pink[_pipe operator_] to join them together:


```{r 02-about-r-37 }
c(1:20) |> summary() |> names() |>  length()
```

--

Read this operator as "_.kjh-pink[**and then**]_"

Better, vertical space is free in R:


```{r 02-about-r-38 }
c(1:20) |> 
  summary() |>

Really not much better:

# The .kjh-yellow[magrittr] pipe: .kjh-pink[`%>%`]

- The pipe operator .kjh-pink[**`|>`**] was not part of Base R until very recently. Pipling was originally introduced in a package called `magrittr`, where it was written .kjh-pink[**`%>%`**] and behaved in very nearly* the same way as the base pipe now does. 

--

- The magrittr pipe continues to work. A lot of existing code uses it (e.g., my book!).

--

- _Sidenote:_ There are bunch of special operators in R that have the naming convention .kjh-pink[**`%something%`**]. For example .kjh-pink[**`%\*%`**] means "matrix multiply". We'll see more of them as we go. In this context the **`% %`** is sometimes pronounced "grapes".  

.footnote.tiny[.kjh-darkgrey[\*With the new pipe, you can only pass an object to the _first_ argument in a function. This is fine for most tidyverse pipelines, where the first argument is usually (implicitly) the data. But it does mean that most Base R functions will continue not to be easily piped, as most of them do not follow the convention of passing the current data as the first argument]]

---

# Functions are bundled into .kjh-yellow[packages]

--

All programming languages gain power and convenience by having libraries or packages of functions that extend the core abilities of the language. In R, packages are loaded into your working environment using the .kjh-green[**`library()`**] function.

# 5. Objects come in .kjh-yellow[types] and .kjh-yellow[classes]

Objects can have more than one (nested) class:

my_smry <- summary(my_numbers) # remember, outputs can be assigned to a name, creating an object

class(summary(my_numbers)) # functions can be nested, and are evaluated from the inside out

class(my_smry) # equivalent to the previous line
```

---

# 5. Objects come in .kjh-yellow[types] and .kjh-yellow[classes]


```{r 02-about-r-48 }

attributes(my_smry)

## In this case, the functions extract the corresponding attribute
class(my_smry)

HW: 

Categorical data, where values come from a fixed set of levels recorded in factor vectors.

Dates (with day resolution), which are recorded in Date vectors.

Date-times (with second or sub-second resolution), which are stored in POSIXct vectors.

Durations, which are stored in difftime vectors.

Underneath, most complex R objects are some kind of list with different components.


???

- A _data frame_ is a list of vectors of the same length, where the vectors can be of different types (e.g. numeric, character, logical, etc)

- A _tibble_ is an enhanced data frame 

Tibbles have an enhanced print method, never coerce strings to factors, and provide stricter subsetting methods. (HW)

Again the object inspector is helpful here

Some classes build on and enhance the properties of simpler classes.

my_numbers

result1 <- my_numbers + 1

--

```{r 02-about-r-59 }

# 6. .kjh-yellow[Arithmetic on vectors]

Note that you got a **warning** here. R will still do what you told it do, though! Don't ignore warnings until you understand what they mean.
