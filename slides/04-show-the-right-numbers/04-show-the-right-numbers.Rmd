# Faceting is a very powerful tool

### A facet is not a geom; it's a way of arranging repeated geoms by some additional variable

--

### Facets use R's "formula" syntax: .kjh-green[`facet_wrap(~ continent)`] 

--

### Read the .kjh-pink[**`~`**] as "on" or "by"

--

### You can also use this syntax: .kjh-green[`facet_wrap(vars(continent))`]

--

### This is newer, and consistent with other ways of referring to variables within tidyverse functions.

- `..ndensity..` here is not in our data! It's _computed_. Histogram and density geoms have default statistics, but you can ask them to do more. The `stat_` functions associated with each `geom_` do this work behind the scenes.
