# Get your data into long format

Very, very often, the solution to some data-wrangling or data visualization problem in a Tidyverse-focused workflow is:

--

## First, get the data into long format.

## Then do the thing you want.

---

# Untidy data is common for good reasons!

Storing data in long format has a lot of _repetition_ and _redundancy_ in a printed table:

.small[
```{r 03-make-a-graph-1 }
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species, island, year) %>% 
  summarize(bill = round(mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),2)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```
]

---

# Untidy data is common for good reasons

Wide form is _easier_ and _more efficient_ to read in print:


.small[
```{r 03-make-a-graph-2 }
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species, island, year) %>% 
  summarize(bill = round(mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 2)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = bill) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

# The most common .kjh-lblue[`tidyr`] operation

Pivoting:

.SMALL[
```{r 03-make-a-graph-3 }
edu
```

The "Level of Schooling Attained" measure is spread across the columns, from `elem4` to `coll4`.


This is fine for a compact table, but for us it should be a single measure, say, "education". 
]
---

# From wide to long with .kjh-green[`pivot_longer()`]

.SMALL.squish2[We're going to put the columns `elem4:coll4` into a new column, creating a new categorical measure named `education`. The numbers currently under each column will become a  new .kjh-green[value] column corresponding to that level of education. ]

```{r 03-make-a-graph-4 }
edu %>% 
  pivot_longer(elem4:coll4, names_to = "education")
```

---

# From wide to long with .kjh-green[`pivot_longer()`]

.SMALL.squish2[We can name the value column to whatever we like. Here it's a number of people.]

# .huge.kjh-lblue[How to get your own data into R]

---

# Reading in CSV files

CSV is not really a proper format at all!

--

Base R has .kjh-green[`read.csv()`]

--

Corresponding tidyverse "underscored" version: .kjh-green[`read_csv()`].

It is pickier and more talkative than the Base R version. Use it instead.

---

# Where's my data? Using .kjh-green[here()]

If we're loading a file, it's coming from _somewhere_.

If it's on our local disk somewhere, we will need to interact with the file system. We should try to do this in a way that avoids _absolute_ file paths. 

```r
# This is not portable!
df <- read_csv("/Users/kjhealy/Documents/data/misc/project/data/mydata.csv")
```

--
  
We should also do it in a way that is _platform independent_. 

This makes it easier to share your work, move it around, etc. Projects should be self-contained.

---

# Where's my data? Using .kjh-green[here()]

The `here` package, and .kjh-green[**`here()`**] function builds paths relative to the top level of your R project. 

```{r 03-make-a-graph-6 }
here() # this path will be different for you
```

---

# Where's the data? Using .kjh-green[here()]

This seminar's files all live in an RStudio project. It looks like this:

```{r 03-make-a-graph-7, echo = FALSE}
fs::dir_tree(here(), recurse = 0)
```

I want to load files from the `data` folder, but I also want _you_ to be able to load them. I'm writing this from somewhere deep in the `slides` folder, but you won't be there. Also, I'm on a Mac, but you may not be.

---

# Where's the data? Using .kjh-green[here()]

 So:

```{r 03-make-a-graph-8 }
## Load the file relative to the path from the top of the project, without separators, etc
organs <- read_csv(file = here("data", "organdonation.csv"))
```

--
.SMALL[

```{r 03-make-a-graph-9 }
organs
```

]

.small[And there it is.]

---

# .kjh-green[`read_csv()`] comes in different varieties


## .kjh-green[**`read_csv()`**] Field separator is a comma: .kjh-red[**`,`**]

```{r 03-make-a-graph-10 }
organs <- read_csv(file = here("data", "organdonation.csv"))
```

## .kjh-green[**`read_csv2()`**] Field separator is a semicolon: .kjh-red[**`;`**]

```r
# Example only
my_data <- read_csv2(file = here("data", "my_euro_file.csv))
```

Both are special cases of .kjh-green[**`read_delim()`**]

---

# Other species are also catered to

- .kjh-green[**`read_tsv()`**] Tab separated.

- .kjh-green[**`read_fwf()`**] Fixed-width files.

- .kjh-green[**`read_log()`**] Log files (i.e. computer log files).

- .kjh-green[**`read_lines()`**] Just read in lines, without trying to parse them.

---

# Also often useful ...

- .kjh-green[**`read_table()`**]  

For data that's separated by one (or more) columns of space.


---

# And for foreign file formats ... 

## The tidyverse's .kjh-lblue[`haven`] package provides

- .kjh-green[**`read_dta()`**]  Stata

- .kjh-green[**`read_spss()`**]  SPSS

- .kjh-green[**`read_sas()`**]  SAS

- .kjh-green[**`read_xpt()`**]  SAS Transport


## Make these functions available with .kjh-green[`library`]`(haven)`

---

# You can read files remotely, too

.SMALL.squish3[
You can give these functions local files, or they can also be pointed at URLs.

Compressed files (`.zip`, `.tar.gz`) will be automatically uncompressed.

(Be careful what you download from remote locations!)]
